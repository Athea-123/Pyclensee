# Pyclense

An Object-Oriented, Data Cleaning Toolkit for Python.

Pyclense is a beginner-friendly Python library designed to simplify and automate essential data cleaning tasks. Built with an object-oriented structure, it allows you to clean, transform, and export datasets using reusable, modular components.

Unlike simple script-based solutions, Pyclense uses *Inheritance*, *Polymorphism*, and *Composition* to create a stable and scalable environment for your data cleaning workflows.

## Key Features

1. *Quick Missing Data Fixer*  
   Spot and fill in blank or empty values in your dataset. You can replace them with mean, median, mode, or a default value — Pyclense handles the logic for you.

2. *Duplicate Remover*  
   Easily detect and remove repeated rows or entries. It highlights duplicates and lets you clean them with a single command.

3. *Format Standardizer*  
   Unify inconsistent formatting in your dataset — such as transforming dates into one format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY) or removing emojis and special symbols from text fields.

4. *Easy Data Preview and Export*  
   Preview your data before and after cleaning using built-in table views. Export the cleaned dataset to CSV or Excel, including an auto-generated cleaning summary.

## Installation
```
Install Pyclense via PyPI:

pip install pyclense
```

### From Source

git clone https://github.com/Athea-123/Pyclense.git
cd Pyclense
pip install -e .

# Quick Start: Using the Pipeline
The recommended way to use Pyclense is via the `CleaningPipeline` orchestrator.

```Python

from pyclense.base import BaseCleaner
from pyclense.duplicate import DuplicateCleaner
from pyclense.missing import MissingDataCleaner
from pyclense.pipeline import CleaningPipeline

# 1. Start with the BaseCleaner, loading data from a file
base_cleaner = BaseCleaner("data/dataset.csv")

# 2. Initialize the pipeline with the initial data holder
pipeline = CleaningPipeline(base_cleaner)

# 3. Add cleaning steps (Cleaner classes)
pipeline.add_step(DuplicateCleaner)
pipeline.add_step(MissingDataCleaner)

# 4. Run the pipeline and get the final cleaned BaseCleaner instance
final_result = pipeline.run()

# 5. Save the result
final_result.save_data("data/cleaned_output.csv")
```

Pyclense uses an object-oriented approach where all specific cleaners inherit from a base class and are managed by a pipeline.

### 1. `BaseCleaner` (Parent Class)

The abstract parent class for all cleaners. It provides fundamental functionality and structure:

* **Data Handling:** Initializes with either a file path (and loads data automatically) or an existing Pandas DataFrame.
* **Accessors:** Provides `@property` access to the underlying DataFrame (`.df`).
* **File I/O:** Includes methods for loading data (`._load_data`) and saving the final cleaned DataFrame (`.save_data(output_path)`).
* **Polymorphism:** Enforces that all subclasses must implement the specific cleaning logic in an overridden `clean()` method.

### 2. `CleaningPipeline` (Orchestrator)

The `CleaningPipeline` is the key for workflow automation using **Composition**.

* It accepts an initial `BaseCleaner` instance (which holds the data).
* It manages a list of cleaning steps (Cleaner classes) added via `add_step()`.
* The `run()` method iterates through the steps, instantiates each cleaner with the current state of the data, executes its `clean()` method, and updates the data for the next step.

## Data Transformers
These modules contain the specific cleaning logic, each overriding the abstract clean() method defined in BaseCleaner.

`DuplicateCleaner `(duplicate.py): This transformer removes rows that are entirely identical across all columns, ensuring only the first occurrence is kept.

`MissingDataCleaner` (missing.py): It's responsible for standardizing missing values. This involves replacing both standard pandas NaN values and strings that contain only whitespace (' ') with the standardized string "None".

`FormatStandardizer` (standardizer.py): This class unifies data formats. Specifically, it standardizes date columns (like 'Review Date') to the MM/DD/YYYY format and removes non-ASCII characters, emojis, or symbols from other text-based columns.
